# Business-Financial-Dashboard-Power-BI-Project
📊 Project Overview
This Power BI dashboard provides a comprehensive financial overview of a simulated mid-sized company. It is built for executive-level decision-making, covering revenue, expenses, net profit, cash flow, budget vs actual performance, and departmental and regional profitability.

The goal of the project is to demonstrate financial storytelling, dashboard interactivity, and technical expertise using Power BI — presented in a clean, business-ready layout.

🧾 Dataset & Business Scenario
This dashboard was developed using sample data simulating a company’s full fiscal year performance. Key insights include:

The company operated at a planned loss, while achieving 99.67% of its annual budget.
This suggests a strategic investment phase — possibly in new technology, finance transformation, or business expansion — prioritizing long-term returns over short-term profit.

Net cash flow was positive during the first half of the year and negative in the second half, indicating a shift in cash use, potentially from operational changes or capital investments.

The Finance department reported the highest losses ($284K), exceeding even Sales and Operations — possibly reflecting large non-operational costs or restructuring efforts.

Regional performance varied significantly:
The North incurred the highest loss ($222.01K), while the South performed better with $103.27K in losses — indicating regional imbalance.
